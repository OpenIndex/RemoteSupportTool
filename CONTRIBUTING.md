# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/RemoteSupportTool.git

Do your changes, push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/OpenIndex/RemoteSupportTool/compare/).

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to comment on pull requests as soon
as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

-   Test your changes.
-   Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
